App for finding and exploring nearby events and parties ðŸŽ‰

This is just a project by 3 students for a module called "Mobile Applications".
The code is documented in English but the general documentation which one can find in the docs directory as a pdf-file is written in German.

## Idea

A mobile application in which the current events / parties in the surrounding area 
are displayed. These events get hotter depending on how many users have agreed to them. The events are created by clubs, bars etc. with their special business accounts. Users can follow one another to see where their friends are celebrating today. In addition, one can rate the organizers or follow them to receive updates and notifications.
